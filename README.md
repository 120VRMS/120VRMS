- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @120VRMS
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a repo which focuses on subjects concering electronics.
- This of coarse is a very broad field of interest, but I am mostly interested in basic analog and digital.
- Lately, I have found interfacing PC's to electronics projects and related test/measurement equipment of interest.
- I am current starting to explore the more advanced subject of microcontroller programming.

- I'm currently a beginner as far as github use is concerned, so please don't judge my repos too harshly :).
